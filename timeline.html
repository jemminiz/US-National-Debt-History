                <h2>1776</h2>
                <p>According to the National Treasury, "The history of the Department of the Treasury began in the turmoil of the American Revolution, when the Continental Congress at Philadelphia deliberated the crucial issue of financing a war of independence against Great Britain." Since the government could not levy taxes or gather money from other governments, there was much turmoil as to how to raise money for fighting Great Britain. To solve this issue, the delegates decided to promise money that they did not yet have to the colonies.</p>

                <h2>1781</h2>
                <p>In 1781, the value of the United States dollar decreased very quickly, "at a rate of 500 to 1000 to 1 to hard currency" (United States National Treasury). After many protests, Robert Morris was designated the Superintendent of Finance in 1781. He balanced the federal budget and restored stability to the nation's finances. He was nicknamed "the Financier" because of his reputation for procuring goods or funds at a moment's notice. His staff included many people, such as a Comptroller, Treasurer, Register, and auditors. They controlled the nation's debt until 1784, when Morris had to resign due to illness. A treasury board continued to oversee budget until 1789.</p>
