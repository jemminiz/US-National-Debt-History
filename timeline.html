                <h2>1776</h2>
                <p>According to the National Treasury, "The history of the Department of the Treasury began in the turmoil of the American
                    Revolution, when the Continental Congress at Philadelphia deliberated the crucial issue of financing a war of
                    independence against Great Britain." Since the government could not levy taxes or gather money from other governments,
                    there was much turmoil as to how to raise money for fighting Great Britain. To solve this issue, the delegates decided
                    to promise money that they did not yet have to the colonies.</p>

                <h2>1781</h2>
                <p>In 1781, the value of the United States dollar decreased very quickly, "at a rate of 500 to 1000 to 1 to hard currency" 
                    (United States National Treasury). After many protests, Robert Morris was designated the Superintendent of Finance in
                    1781. He balanced the federal budget and restored stability to the nation's finances. He was nicknamed "the Financier"
                    because of his reputation for procuring goods or funds at a moment's notice. His staff included many people, such as a
                    Comptroller, Treasurer, Register, and auditors. They controlled the nation's debt until 1784, when Morris had to resign
                    due to illness. A treasury board continued to oversee budget until 1789.</p>

                <h2>1789</h2>
                <p>In 1789, the United States' Government switched to the United States Constitution. The First Congress was called to
                    convene in New York in March of 1789. On September 2nd, Congress created a permanent institution for the management
                    of government finances, known as the Department of Treasury. Alexander Hamilton served as the first Secretary of the
                    Treasury, and did much with the United States' finances. Much to Congress' surprise, he insisted upon taking the 
                    country's war debt and paying it back dollar for dollar. This allowed the country to regain public credit. Hamilton
                    also created things like the United States Bank, which does not exist anymore but used to act as the government's fiscal
                    agent.

                <p>In 1803, the United States Senate approved the purchase of the Louisiana Territory from France. According to the Senate,
                    "As a result of this treaty, the nation doubled in size, adding territory that would become the states of Louisiana,
                    Arkansas, Missouri, Iowa, Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, and parts of Minnesota, New Mexico,
                    Montana, Wyoming, and Colorado." Because of Napoleon's problems with the slave revolt in Haiti and other things, he was
                    needy for funds and the U.S. only spent $15,000,000.00 on the Louisiana Purchase, which translates to $340,000,000 in
                    today's money.</p>

                <p>In 1814, the United States Senate had to meet in different "emergency quarters" because the Capitol of the United States
                    had burned down in the War of 1812. Eventually, in 1815, the Senate authorized the President to borrow from different
                    local banks to fix the Capitol, White House, and cabinet quarters on their existing grounds. The Senate also bought
                    a library in 1814 to replace the Congressional Library that was destroyed in the War of 1812.

                <h2>1890</h2>
                <p>Captain Alfred Thayer Mahan was a lecturer in naval history and president of the United States Naval War College. He also
                    published many important papers such as <i>The Influence of Sea Power upon History, 1669-1783</i>. He argued that
                    British domination was largely due to their control of the seas. As such, he talked to the President of the United
                    States and other people in charge and he focused extremely hard on the acquisition of naval bases. This was not a New
                    phenomenon, especially with the purchase of Alaska in 1867, but Mahan's domination and true mastery of the theories of
                    the seas gave him the power to make true change. In the 1890s, Mahan's ideas resonated with leading politicians, who
                    made policies around his ideas. This lead to many economic victories for the United States such as the perpetual
                    lease for a naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.<br><br>Source:

                <p>In 1898, the Spanish-American War ended Spain's colonial empire in the Western Hemisphere and secured the United States'
                    position as a Pacific power. United States' victory against Spain produced a peace treaty that included the acquisition
                    of Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Phillipines for the United States. The U.S. also annexed Hawai'i during the war. There
                    was much government spending throughout the war, as would be expected, such as troops for blockades and fighting.

                <p>The United States fought in the Phillipine-American war because the Filipinos wanted independence rather than a new
                    colonial ruler. During the war, over 4,200 Americans and 20,000 Filipinos died from combat, and as many as 200,000
                    Filipino citizens died from poor living conditions such as famine, disease, and violence. The decision to annex
                    the Phillipines was not without domestic criticism either. Those who disliked the annexation of the Phillipines
                    argued that it was immoral for the United States to engage in colonialism, but supporters countered that it would
                    increase economic opportunity for both the United States and the Phillipines.

                <p>World War One was a major part of the history of not only the United States, but the world as a whole. It caused major

                    went before Congress to request a declaration of war against Germany, citing their breaking of their pledge to
                    suspend unrestricted submarine warfare in the North Atlantic and the Mediterranean, and their attempts to entice
                    Mexico into an alliance against the United States. The Senate and Congress both agreed that war should be declared in
                    early April of 1917, and later declared war on Austria-Hungary, an ally of Germany, in December of that year.

                <p>In 1945, the first Atomic Bomb was tested successfully. This gave the United States a very strong lead in weapons and
                    allowed them to use the atomic bomb as a weapon of peace, and as a bargaining tool. This did not happen for very long,
                    as the Soviet Union exploded their first successful atomic bomb in 1949, the United Kingdom in 1952, France in 1960, and
                    the People's Republic of China in 1964. This atomic bomb was a major reason for the Cold War between the United States and
                    the Soviet Union, as both had atomic weapons but neither wanted to use them first. That created a policy of "Mutually
                    Assured Destruction", where each country would destroy the other given a threat of destruction. Once these bombs became
                    more widespread, countries such as the United States were no longer able to use them to be "the great peacemakers"
                    and get what they wanted because they always had the pressure of a counter-attack.

                    Europe post-WWII. Because of the Communist expansion and the rapid deterioration of European economies in the winter of
                    1946-47, Congress passed the Economic Cooperation Act in March of 1948 and approved funding that would eventually rise
                    to over $12,000,000,000.00 for the rebuilding of Western Europe. The Marshall Plan was amazing for the United States
                    because it created a market for U.S. goods. Eastern Europe nearly participated but Stalin shot down the idea. It might've
                    been better for the Eastern Europe to not because Congress may not have funded the program as heavily. However, the
                    Marshall Plan was one of the best humanitarian efforts in the history of the United States.

                <p>The North Atlantic Treaty Organization, otherwise known as NATO, was the first peacetime military alliance that the United
                    States entered into that was outside of the Western Hemisphere. After WWII, the nations of Europe struggled to rebuild

                    their distance from the fighting of WWII and their good economic standing. The United States saw a strong Europe as the
                    way to keep peace in the world. As such, they helped the European nations rebuild and regain their economic status.
                    Due to this, and many other factors such as the Western European nations, Eastern Europe entered into a treaty with the
                    each other, known as the Brussels Treaty, that ensured mutual protection. At the same time, the Truman administration
                    increased military spending and instituted a peacetime draft. They also pressured the House to allow a military

                <h3>1955</h3>
                <p>The United States and the People's Republic of China opened a series of ambassadorial-level talks in 1955 in Geneva to
                    discuss the repatriation of nationals and other issues of mutual concern. Because they did not have diplomatic connections,
                    formally, the talks were the first contact in 16 years. This occurred due to the People's Republic of China bombing
                    off-shore islands in the Taiwan Strait. The crisis ended when the Chinese Foreign Minister decided that each country
                    should bring in ambassadors. Once it was clear that the United States would not recognize the PRC as its own country,
                    the Chinese arrested Americans still living in China, and the United States retaliated by doing the same. Eventually,
                    a treaty was created and the U.S. recognized the PRC, which relieved the tension between the two nations.

                <h3>Space Race</h3>
                <p>The "Space Race" refers to a race between the United States and the Soviet Union between 1957 and ending as late as 1975
                    to create the first artificial satellite around the Earth. The Soviet Union was the first to launch an artificial
                    satellite, called <i>Sputnik-1</i>, in 1957. The President of the United States tried to downplay the importance of this
                    to the United States' citizens, but especially after the explosion of the <i>Vanguard</i>, President Eisenhower pushed
                    even harder and funded more into the United States' space programs. Eventually, in 1958, the United States launched their
                    firstsatellite into orbit, known as the <i>Explorer</i>. In many ways, the launch of the <i>Sputnik</i> further pushed
                    the arms and space race to new heights.

                    States' financial power. In 1980, on June 6, the United States had a National Debt of roughly $969,700,000,000. However,
                    the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the United States, or how much it makes, was more than $2,000,000,000,000. Overall,
                    the United States was very healthy and seems to be going in a great direction.
