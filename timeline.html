                <h2>1776</h2>
                <p>According to the National Treasury, "The history of the Department of the Treasury began in the turmoil of the American
                    Revolution, when the Continental Congress at Philadelphia deliberated the crucial issue of financing a war of
                    independence against Great Britain." Since the government could not levy taxes or gather money from other governments,
                    there was much turmoil as to how to raise money for fighting Great Britain. To solve this issue, the delegates decided
                    to promise money that they did not yet have to the colonies.</p>

                <h2>1781</h2>
                <p>In 1781, the value of the United States dollar decreased very quickly, "at a rate of 500 to 1000 to 1 to hard currency" 
                    (United States National Treasury). After many protests, Robert Morris was designated the Superintendent of Finance in
                    1781. He balanced the federal budget and restored stability to the nation's finances. He was nicknamed "the Financier"
                    because of his reputation for procuring goods or funds at a moment's notice. His staff included many people, such as a
                    Comptroller, Treasurer, Register, and auditors. They controlled the nation's debt until 1784, when Morris had to resign
                    due to illness. A treasury board continued to oversee budget until 1789.</p>

                <h2>1789</h2>
                <p>In 1789, the United States' Government switched to the United States Constitution. The First Congress was called to
                    convene in New York in March of 1789. On September 2nd, Congress created a permanent institution for the management
                    of government finances, known as the Department of Treasury. Alexander Hamilton served as the first Secretary of the
                    Treasury, and did much with the United States' finances. Much to Congress' surprise, he insisted upon taking the 
                    country's war debt and paying it back dollar for dollar. This allowed the country to regain public credit. Hamilton
                    also created things like the United States Bank, which does not exist anymore but used to act as the government's fiscal
                    agent.

                <h2>1803</h2>
                <p>In 1803, the United States Senate approved the purchase of the Louisiana Territory from France. According to the Senate,
                    "As a result of this treaty, the nation doubled in size, adding territory that would become the states of Louisiana,
                    Arkansas, Missouri, Iowa, Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, and parts of Minnesota, New Mexico,
                    Montana, Wyoming, and Colorado." Because of Napoleon's problems with the slave revolt in Haiti and other things, he was
                    needy for funds and the U.S. only spent $15,000,000.00 on the Louisiana Purchase, which translates to $340,000,000 in
                    today's money.</p>

                <h2>1814</h2>
                <p>In 1814, the United States Senate had to meet in different "emergency quarters" because the Capitol of the United States
                    had burned down in the War of 1812. Eventually, in 1815, the Senate authorized the President to borrow from different
                    local banks to fix the Capitol, White House, and cabinet quarters on their existing grounds. The Senate also bought
                    a library in 1814 to replace the Congressional Library that was destroyed in the War of 1812.

                <p>In 1816, the United States Congress passed the compensation act, giving members of Congress a salary of $1500/year
                    instead of their previous $6/diem. This caused an outrage in the United States which caused Congressmen to, a few years
                    later, repeal the law in favor of their $6/diem. Senators and Congressmen didn't get an annual salary until 1855,
                    when they got $3,000/year, which was about the salary of a government clerk. <br><br>Source:

                    not used or governed for many years until a major gold deposit was found, when the U.S. then took major interest in
                    Alaska. <br><br>Source: <a href="https://history.state.gov/milestones/1866-1898/alaska-purchase" class="button" target="_blank"

                <h2>1890</h2>
                <p>Captain Alfred Thayer Mahan was a lecturer in naval history and president of the United States Naval War College. He also
                    published many important papers such as <i>The Influence of Sea Power upon History, 1669-1783</i>. He argued that
                    British domination was largely due to their control of the seas. As such, he talked to the President of the United
                    States and other people in charge and he focused extremely hard on the acquisition of naval bases. This was not a New
                    phenomenon, especially with the purchase of Alaska in 1867, but Mahan's domination and true mastery of the theories of
                    the seas gave him the power to make true change. In the 1890s, Mahan's ideas resonated with leading politicians, who
                    made policies around his ideas. This lead to many economic victories for the United States such as the perpetual
                    lease for a naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.<br><br>Source:

                <p>In 1898, the Spanish-American War ended Spain's colonial empire in the Western Hemisphere and secured the United States'
                    position as a Pacific power. United States' victory against Spain produced a peace treaty that included the acquisition
                    of Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Phillipines for the United States. The U.S. also annexed Hawai'i during the war. There
                    was much government spending throughout the war, as would be expected, such as troops for blockades and fighting.

                <p>The United States, after winning the Spanish-American War, made policies that allowed them to further their own economic
                    interests. Some of these policies include the "Open Door" policy and the addition to the Monroe Doctrine, known as the
                    Roosevelt Collary, that formally declares the United States' intention to use military force to defend the Western
                    Hemisphere from the Europeans. The Panama Canal was also constructed during this time, and created many new trade
                    opportunities previously unthinkable. <br><br>Source: <a href="https://history.state.gov/milestones/1899-1913/foreword"

                <p>The United States fought in the Phillipine-American war because the Filipinos wanted independence rather than a new
                    colonial ruler. During the war, over 4,200 Americans and 20,000 Filipinos died from combat, and as many as 200,000
                    Filipino citizens died from poor living conditions such as famine, disease, and violence. The decision to annex
                    the Phillipines was not without domestic criticism either. Those who disliked the annexation of the Phillipines
                    argued that it was immoral for the United States to engage in colonialism, but supporters countered that it would
                    increase economic opportunity for both the United States and the Phillipines.

                <p>World War One was a major part of the history of not only the United States, but the world as a whole. It caused major
                    economic and military decisions for the countries of the world. As for the United States, President Woodrow Wilson
                    went before Congress to request a declaration of war against Germany, citing their breaking of their pledge to
                    suspend unrestricted submarine warfare in the North Atlantic and the Mediterranean, and their attempts to entice
                    Mexico into an alliance against the United States. The Senate and House both agreed that war should be declared in
                    early April of 1917, and later declared war on Austria-Hungary, an ally of Germany, in December of that year.
